## How to Play

1. **Rules**:
   - **Paper (1)** beats **Rock (2)**.
   - **Rock (2)** beats **Scissors (3)**.
   - **Scissors (3)** beats **Paper (1)**.
   - If both players choose the same option, itâ€™s a draw.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - The player enters a number corresponding to their choice:
     - `1` for Paper
     - `2` for Rock
     - `3` for Scissors
   - The computer also makes its choice, and the winner is displayed.
